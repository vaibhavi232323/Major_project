1. Importing the packages
2. Exploring the dataset - Heart Disease UCI data
3. data processing
	- Droping the unwanted columns using pandas dataframes
	- Droping the null rows using .drop() function
4. visualization using seaborn & matplotlib
5. Label Encoding and Feature Selection 
6. building the model
	- SVM
	- RF
	- DT
	- LR
	- KNN
	- XGBoost
	- GAussian Naive Bayes
	- Voting Classifier
	- GBDT
	- Bagging+GBDT
	- Fuzzy+GBDT
	- Bagging+Fuzzy+GBDT
	
7. training the model
8. building the model with Voting Classifier since it gives better score comparing with Other Models 
9. Flask Framework with Sqlite for signup and signin
10. importing the packages
11. User gives input as Feature Values 
12. the given input is preprocessed for prediction
13. trained model is used for prediction
14. final outcome is displayed through frontend

Note:

Extension - Voting Classifier and other SVM, RF, LR, XGB, NB are existing system,is build as Extension for feature values
and Voting Classifier is used for prediction since we it gives better score and low MSE value comparing with other Models
